## Multi-Layer Review Framework

### Layer 1: Immediate Safety Checks 🚨
```
- Secrets/API keys exposure (scan for patterns)
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication bypasses
- Resource exhaustion risks
```

### Layer 2: Code Quality Analysis 📊
```
- Cyclomatic complexity (threshold: 10)
- Function length (max: 50 lines)
- Class cohesion metrics
- Coupling analysis
- DRY principle violations
```

### Layer 3: Architectural Integrity 🏗️

#### 🎯 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - CRITICAL FOCUS
```
SRP Violation Detection Patterns:

1. **Class/Module Level**:
   - Multiple reasons to change
   - Mixed concerns (e.g., business logic + data access)
   - God classes (>300 lines or >10 public methods)
   - Feature envy (using other class data excessively)

2. **Function/Method Level**:
   - Multiple abstraction levels
   - Side effects in pure functions
   - Command-Query separation violations
   - Functions with "and", "or" in names

3. **Common SRP Violations**:
   ❌ UserService handles: authentication + profile + notifications
   ✅ Split into: AuthService, ProfileService, NotificationService
   
   ❌ saveUserAndSendEmail()
   ✅ saveUser() + separate EmailService.send()
   
   ❌ class OrderProcessor { 
       calculatePrice()
       validatePayment()
       updateInventory()
       sendConfirmation()
     }
   ✅ Separate: PriceCalculator, PaymentValidator, 
              InventoryManager, NotificationService
```

#### SRP Analysis Checklist:
```markdown
For each class/module/function, ask:
□ What is the ONE reason this should change?
□ Can I describe its purpose without using "AND"?
□ Does it have a single, well-defined responsibility?
□ Are all methods/properties directly related to that responsibility?
□ Would changes to requirements affect multiple methods?
```

#### Other SOLID Principles:
```
- Open/Closed principle compliance
- Liskov substitution verification
- Interface segregation check
- Dependency inversion validation
```

### Layer 4: Performance Profiling ⚡
```
- Algorithm complexity (O-notation)
- Database query optimization
- Memory leak potential
- Caching opportunities
- Async/await proper usage
```

### Layer 5: Maintainability Assessment 🔧
```
- Code readability score
- Documentation coverage
- Test coverage & quality
- Error handling robustness
- Logging effectiveness
```

**Risk Level**: [LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL]
**Technical Debt Impact**: [+X hours]
**SRP Compliance Score**: [X/100]

### Detailed Findings

#### 🔴 CRITICAL - Single Responsibility Violations
```markdown
**Violation Type**: Mixed Responsibilities
**Class/Function**: `UserController`
**Current Responsibilities**: 
  1. User authentication
  2. Profile management
  3. Email notifications
  4. Data validation

**Impact**: 
- High coupling between unrelated features
- Difficult to test in isolation
- Multiple teams need to modify same file

**Refactoring Suggestion**:
​```typescript
// ❌ Current: Multiple responsibilities
class UserController {
  async registerUser(data) {
    // Validates data
    if (!this.isValidEmail(data.email)) throw new Error();
    
    // Creates user
    const user = await this.db.createUser(data);
    
    // Sends email
    await this.sendWelcomeEmail(user.email);
    
    // Generates token
    const token = this.generateAuthToken(user);
    
    return { user, token };
  }
}

// ✅ Refactored: Single responsibilities
class UserRegistrationService {
  constructor(
    private validator: UserValidator,
    private userRepository: UserRepository,
    private emailService: EmailService,
    private authService: AuthService
  ) {}
  
  async registerUser(data: UserRegistrationDTO) {
    await this.validator.validate(data);
    const user = await this.userRepository.create(data);
    await this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user);
    const token = await this.authService.generateToken(user);
    return { user, token };
  }
}
​```

**Benefits**:
- Each service has one clear responsibility
- Easy to mock dependencies for testing
- Changes to email logic don't affect user creation
- Can reuse services in other contexts
```

#### 🟡 WARNINGS (Should Fix)
```markdown
**Issue**: Function doing too much
**Location**: `utils/dataProcessor.js:23`
**Responsibilities Detected**: 3
  1. Data validation
  2. Data transformation  
  3. Data persistence

**Suggestion**: Split into validate(), transform(), and save() functions
```

#### 🟢 SUGGESTIONS (Nice to Have)
```markdown
**Enhancement**: Extract policy object
**Current**: Multiple if-statements checking user permissions
**Suggested**: Create UserPermissionPolicy class
**Benefit**: Centralized permission logic, easier to test
```

## SRP-Specific Detection Rules

```yaml
Red Flags:
  - Method names with "And", "Or"
  - Classes with >5 public methods
  - Files > 200 lines
  - Multiple imports from different layers
  - Mixed I/O and business logic
  - Utility/Helper/Manager class names

Metrics:
  - Cohesion score < 0.5
  - Coupling score > 0.7
  - Method complexity > 10
  - Class fan-out > 7
```

## Context-Aware SRP Analysis

### For Different Paradigms
```yaml
Object-Oriented:
  - One class, one responsibility
  - Cohesive methods
  - Clear class names

Functional:
  - Pure functions
  - Single transformation per function
  - Composition over complexity

Microservices:
  - One service, one domain
  - Clear bounded contexts
  - Minimal inter-service dependencies
```

## Example SRP Review Comments

### Example 1: God Class
```markdown
### 🔴 God Class Detected: `ApplicationManager`

This class has 15 public methods handling unrelated concerns:
- User management (4 methods)
- File operations (3 methods)
- Email sending (2 methods)
- Report generation (3 methods)
- Configuration (3 methods)

**Refactor into**:
- `UserService`
- `FileService`
- `EmailService`
- `ReportService`
- `ConfigService`

Each service should have 3-5 focused methods.
```

### Example 2: Mixed Concerns Function
```markdown
### 🟡 Function Violates SRP: `processOrder()`

Current function handles:
1. Inventory check
2. Payment processing
3. Order creation
4. Email notification

**Suggested refactor**:
​```javascript
// Split into focused functions
async function processOrder(orderData) {
  await checkInventory(orderData.items);
  const payment = await processPayment(orderData.payment);
  const order = await createOrder(orderData, payment);
  await notifyCustomer(order);
  return order;
}
​```
```

Remember: Every piece of code should have ONE clear reason to change. When reviewing, always ask "What is the single responsibility of this code?"
